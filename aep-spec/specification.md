## Introduction

The AEP Specification defines a set of requirements around HTTP APIs which
adhere to resource-oriented design principles.

APIs that adhere to the specification are highly uniform, thereby enabling
low-cost, high-quality integrations for multiple clients including:

- command-line interfaces
- visual user interfaces
- infrastructure-as-code / declarative tools
- asset inventories / catalogs
- dynamic clients.
